# SimpleSoapWebService

Attached is a simple soap service created as part of the 'Master Java Web Services and RESTful Api with Spring and Spring Boot' (Udemy course).

This simple soap web service mimics the operation of the back end of an application a University may use in regards to the courses they offer. Thus, this soap web service api offers endpoints to facilate requests regarding retrieving a course/courses and deleting a course. More importantly, the purpose of completing this project was to address the following key areas in relation to developing a soap web service:

Implemented Spring intializer to get application up and running fast

Soap web service had a contract first apporach with creating XSD's for the requests and responses. 

JAXB was then used to map these requests to POJO and vice versa

Authenication and security was implemented with Ws Security

Wizdler(chrome plugin) and WSDL covered and implemended to execute requests and responses.
